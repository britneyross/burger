# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Function
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in the MySQL database, whether devoured or not.
