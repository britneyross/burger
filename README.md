# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Function
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the right side of the page -- waiting to be eaten.

Each burger in the waiting area has a "Eat" button. When the user clicks it, the burger's status will change to "Eaten!".
